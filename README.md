Download the .zip from the green 'Clone or download' button above and to the right or [Click Here](https://github.com/connconnfuntime/Automated-UAC-Bypass/archive/master.zip "Master.zip Download")

*Note: The download may be flagged as a virus. That's because it basically is. You're accessing admin priveledges when you shouldn't be. You can always verify code inside of each file here on GitHub before downloading if you don't want to blindly trust someone on the internet by downloading any files.*

Extract the downloaded .zip file.

Locate the file aptly named "Right-Click-Run-with-PowerShell" and, as the name suggests, right click the file and run with PowerShell.

Follow the prompt in the new popup window.

I suggest using the file location of the 'addadmin.bat' file inside the extracted folder.

It should be set to that location by default. Otherwise, change it manually.


I suggest using the program 'UAC Pass' in conjunction with this program. If you would like to use it, you can find it at https://sites.google.com/site/freeavvarea/UACPass-en.
