Download the .zip from the green "Clone or download" button above and to the right.

Extract the downloaded .zip file.

Locate the file aptly named "Right-Click-Run-with-PowerShell" and, as the name suggests, right click the file and run with PowerShell.

Follow the prompt in the new popup window.

I suggest using the file location of the 'addadmin.bat' file inside the extracted folder.

It should be set to that location by default. Otherwise, change it manually.
